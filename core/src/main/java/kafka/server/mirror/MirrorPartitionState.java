/**
 * Represents the lifecycle states of a mirror partition.
 * FAILED state can be entered from PREPARING or MIRRORING when errors occur.
 * <pre>
 * 1. INITIALIZING
 *    Triggered by: AddTopicsToMirror API call
 *    Waits for: Metadata update (partition becomes read-only leader)
 *
 * 2. PREPARING
 *    Triggered by: Metadata update callback in MirrorMetadataManager
 *    Actions: Fetch last mirrored offsets, schedule truncation
 *
 * 3. MIRRORING
 *    Triggered by: ISR truncation completion in Partition.checkIsrTruncationAndTransition
 *    Actions: Start MirrorFetcherThread to replicate data
 *
 * 4. STOPPING
 *    Triggered by: RemoveTopicsFromMirror API or topic deletion
 *    Actions: Record last mirrored offsets to internal topic
 *
 * 5. STOPPED
 *    Triggered by: Last mirrored offsets persisted
 *    Result: Topic becomes writable on destination cluster
 * </pre>
